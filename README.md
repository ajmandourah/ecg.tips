# Ecg.tips
An Electrocardiogram (ECG) website which aim to explain the main concepts behind the most common cases in an easy light arabic language. Through the years in the medical school I searched around for an ECG guide in the most simplest form and although I did find some awesome sites no one has ever thought about doing such a site in Arabic. The targeted group are mainly medical students in the first 3-4 years.

The site itself is made entirely by me Anmar Mandourah a Saudi doctor doing his fellow in Cardiology in Sweden. It was written in my free time on the train/bus while I am commuting to the hospital. I am aiming to update the content when I find the time as well as changing the design to include more animations which will get the content to deepen in the memories of the students.
